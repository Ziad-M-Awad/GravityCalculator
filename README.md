Modify the example program to compute the position of an object after falling for 10 seconds, outputting the position in meters. The formula in Math notation is: x(t) = 0.5 Ã— at 2 + vit + xi Variable Meaning Value a Acceleration (m/s 2 ) -9.81 t Time (s) 10 vi Initial velocity (m/s) 0 xi Initial position 0 Note: The correct value is -490.5 m. Java will output more digits after the decimal place, but that is unimportant.
